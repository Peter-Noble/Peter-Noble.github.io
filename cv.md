Projects were run by a number of professionals, and in the last few years I have led several projects myself.

#### Organisation, management and leadership

Working on over thirty five shows and numerous events, often in roles of leadership, has helped me develop these qualities. I have always excelled in high pressure theatre and event production settings.

#### Conscientious and focused
I do not settle for second-rate work. I take personal pride and responsibility for the work I do, and apply attention to detail.  I can be relied upon to deliver on what I have committed to.

This is demonstrated by my academic performance and consistent positive feedback from events and shows I have helped to run.

#### Lighting desk programming

Proficient at programming and operating MA dot2 and ETC EOS (Element and Ion) and working knowledge of Avolites Titan and Zero88.

#### Digital sound desk experience
