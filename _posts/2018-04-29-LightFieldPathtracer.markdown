3rd year undergraduate research project investigating the use of light fields as environment maps as an alternative to traditional spherical or cube maps.

I wrote a path trace renderer built on Intel Embree, CImg and TinyObjLoader.

The aim of the project was to investigate the possibility of using cameras like Google are developing (<a href="https://www.fxguide.com/featured/paul-debevecs-new-light-field-research/">fxguide</a>) to produce more accurate position dependent lighting than is possible with a simple 2D spherical environement map.

Conclusion: The hardware has a way to go and file formats and processing need industry standards before this technique can become practical for production. Once those things are in place light fields could be a valuable tool for saving artist's time when rendering objects in some difficult lighting conditions.

More information to follow once the university has evaluated the project.
