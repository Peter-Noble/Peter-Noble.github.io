A crowd simulation plugin used in the development of Channel 4's Electric Dreams and an upcoming show with Amazon Prime.

CrowdMaster originated from my Computing A level project (2014). Since then it has continued to grow in scope. At its heart is a fuzzy logic agent based system and a procedural node based agent placement system.

<small> The brain for a collision prediction and avoidance agents. See <a href="https://vimeo.com/210173152">Vimeo - Collision prediction</a>.</small>

CrowdMaster is now developed by [John Roper] and myself. I mainly concentrate on the core simulation and agent generation code while John focusses on UI, utilities, website and releases although there is a lot of crossover and collaboration. We've also been supported by a number of other developers and artists and in particular [Theory Studios].
