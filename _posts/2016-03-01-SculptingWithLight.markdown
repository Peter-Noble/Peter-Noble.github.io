During the summer of 2016 I ran a workshop for 11 11-16 year olds on projection mapping. Across 4 days I supervised them as we constructed a 3D screen and created a short performance. The skills taught were tailored to what the kids were enjoying doing and what was needed to create the ideas they came up with. In the end we used Adobe Premiere and Photoshop, Black Magic Design Fusion 8, iStopMotion, camera work, lighting, projectors and green screen.
