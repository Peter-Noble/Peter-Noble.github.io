CrowdMaster is a project that originated from my Computing A level project (2014). Since then it has continued to grow in scope. At its heart is a fuzzy logic agent based system and a procedural node based agent placement system.

CrowdMaster is now developed by [John Roper] and myself. I mainly concentrate on the core simulation and agent generation code while John focusses on UI, utilities, website and releases although there is a lot of crossover and collaboration. We're also been supported by a number of other developers and artists and in particular [Theory Studios].

Please see the [Official website] and the [Github] page for more details.
