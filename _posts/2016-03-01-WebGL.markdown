As the assignment for a submodule at level 2 I had to create a WebGL application to render a car. No frameworks (eg. Three.js) or prewritten shaders were allowed. Directional and point lighting are implemented along with reflections

Twitter-Sphere

This was my first encounter with open/webGL. In 24 hours a team of 4 created a web application to analyse the tweets made by a user and visualise them with a 3D graph rendered in the browser. I was responsible for all the graphics while my teammates dealt with Twitter and Google natural language APIs.
