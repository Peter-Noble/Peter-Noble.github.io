I am a 2nd year Computer Science student at Durham University.

When I'm not studying I will often be found working behind the scenes at shows and events as a technician or working on a personal film or VFX projects.

Once I graduate I would like to work in an industry where I can use my technical skills to help create visuals and so combine my love of technology, performance and film.
